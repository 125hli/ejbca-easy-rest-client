# Erce â€“ The Easy Rest Client for EJBCA

Erce is a fully FOSS REST Client for EJBCA Community Edition. Its purpose is to act as a REST-based alterative to the EJBCA CLI and other enrollment protocols such as SCEP and CMP in environments where the UI is not available/optimal, but also to allow for further scripting by branching and extending this implementation. Erce is compatible with EJBCA 7.9.0.1 and later. 

## Get started 

Erce is a fully self contained Maven project. To build:

1. Check out a local branch 
2. Build and package using Maven:
```
mvn clean package
```
3. Run the resulting .jar file with the --help flag to see the available commands.
